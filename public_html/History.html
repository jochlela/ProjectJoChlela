The name comes from the Greek,<br>from the Tyrian purple dye which they were especially famous for; in the Bible, they are<br>called Sidonians (after the city of Sidon). <br><br>The Phoenicians were traders, involved in<br>international trade between the Middle Eastern hinterland, and countries around the<br>Mediterranean.<br><br>Phoenicians discovered and used the North Star (Polaris) to keep their<br>bearings at sea. They were the first ones to sail around Africa. They colonized parts of<br>Cyprus and Rhodes and crossed the Black Sea. They founded<br>Tarshish on the coast of Spain and Carthage in North Africa.<br>Each of the coastal cities was an independent kingdom noted for the special activities of<br>its inhabitants. Tyre and Sidon were important maritime and trade centers; Gubla (later<br>known as Byblos and now as Jbail) and Berytus (present-day Beirut) were trade and<br>religious centers. Gubla was the first Phoenician city to trade actively with.<br><br>The first alphabet was made of 22 phonetics and was invented by a Phoenician trader<br>from Byblos called Kadmous. The latter transported his invention during his trips to all<br>other continents and countries he visited.<br>The invention of the first alphabet can be considered as one of the most important contributions of these people to the international<br>culture. From this alphabet, the Greek alphabet, which forms the basis of all European<br>alphabets, has been derived. The alphabets of the Middle East and India also derive from<br>the Phoenician alphabet. <br><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:21px;"><strong><em><u>The ottoman Empire:</u><br></em></strong></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;"><strong><br>1516</strong><br>The Ottoman Empire at least nominally ruled Lebanon from its conquest in 1516 until the end of World War I in 1918. The Ottoman sultan, Salim I, invaded Syria and Lebanon.<br><br><strong>1572</strong><br>Emir Fakhr el-Dine II from the Lebanese Druze family of Ma'an became the third Ma'an<br>emir to govern the Emirate of the Shouf. Ambitious but wise, he set out to enlarge and<br>enrich his emirate, and surrounded himself with Christian, Druze and Muslims advisors.<br>He succeeded in annexing the Bekaa, Sayda, the Kesrwan and Beirut and gained control of parts of Syria and Palestine. <br><br><strong>1610</strong><br>The first printing press of the empire was built in Lebanon, in the Monastery of Qozhaya,<br>in the Kadisha valley, using &quot;Syriac&quot; characters, a language close to that of the Aramaic<br>that Jesus Christ spoke. <br><br><strong>1613</strong><br>The army of the Wali of Damascus invaded the region. Fakhr el-Dine fled to Italy, but<br>returned after five years of exile, and re-conquered his emirate. His victory was such that<br>the Ottoman Sultan gave him the tile of &quot;sultan el-barr&quot;. But Fakhr el-Dine became too<br>powerful. <br><br><strong>1633</strong><br>Fakhr el-Dine was captured and imprisoned in Istanbul. He was executed two years later. . <br><br><strong>1914-1918</strong><br>World War 1 resulted in famine and diseases. Grasshoppers drowned Lebanon.The Turks commandered Lebanon's food supplies and requisitioned its beasts of burden which resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths from widespread famine. The land also became a paradise for disease, and plagues claimed thousands of souls. <br><br>When the Turkish Empire collapsed after World War I, France took over the rule of<br>Lebanon. This lasted until 1943, when Lebanon became an independent nation.<br><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:21px;"><strong><u>Civil war:</u><br></strong></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;">A war started in Lebanon between 1975 and 1990, which results a heavy loose.<br>Since 1990 and till now, Lebanon is trying to recover the destruction.<br>During the war from 1975 to 1990 more than:<br>200,000 Lebanese have been killed<br>250,000 seriously wounded<br>800,000 displaced from their homes,<br>2/3 of them are Christians and 1/3 are<br>Muslims and Druzes<br>9,600 Handicapped dead-alive<br>17,000 Missing persons.<br>13,000 Kidnapped <br>950,000 left the country: about 2/3 being Christians and 1/3 Muslims<br>145,000 destroyed houses<br>In global, 3,7% of the population were killed, 10% wounded, 25% forced to inner (local)<br>emigration and 33% to outer emigration.<br><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:19px;"><strong>For a full detailed history of Lebanon <a href="http://www.rcplonline.org/research-study/History%20Lebanon.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> .<br></strong></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;"><br><br></span></div>
